## Code
All code is stored in the code folder. To run the code, run the 'run.ipynb' file. To evaluate the performance, run the 'eval.ipynb' file. During the evaluation process, the test data and the data generated by the model should be stored in two folders within the 'code' folder. (For example, you can put it in the 'test'and 'model_generated' folders)

There are two main files. On is model (e.g. my_model_noise_filter.py). These file are used to implement different kinds of models. The other is train (e.g. my_train_noise_filter.py). These file are used to train the corresponding model. Generally, we only need to run the train file to get final result.

During training, the model generated results will be stored in output folder (for both training and testing stages).

## Data
